## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make a hover button

To see how you can make a hover button

```css
button:hover{
    background-color: transparent;
    color: white;
    border: 2px solid white;
}
}
```

If you want more help with with buttons, I recommend checking out [Animated Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_animate_buttons.asp) to learn more.


### Continued development

I would love to learn more about flex
